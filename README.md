# Telestrations Prompts
My friends and I enjoy playing DIY [Telestrations](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/46213/telestrations) using the [A4 zine method](http://experimentwithnature.com/03-found/experiment-with-paper-how-to-make-a-one-page-zine/).

We couldn't think of a fun word list, so we used White Cards from [Cards Against Humanity](https://cardsagainsthumanity.com/)'s standard deck.

## Usage
1. Using an A4 piece of paper, fold a booklet (see 'A4 zine method' link above).
1. Write your name on the front.
1. Click the button to generate a new prompt.
    - Click the reset button to clear the prompt.
1. If playing with an even number of people, write the prompt AND draw the prompt on the next page.
    - If playing with an ODD number of people, write the prompt, then pass it to the player to your right.
1. Once you've passed on your booklet, you will have received a booklet - if the previous page was a written prompt, try to draw it! If it was a drawing, try to guess what the drawing is of and write it down!
1. Continue until your booklet returns to you.
1. Share results with the group and lol.
